# readAloud-valence-alpha

## Project Goal
Broadly: how does the processing of emotional inputs impact our behavior?  Specifically:
* In what ways does lexical valence (including known effects in semantic integration and priming) impact overall performance and post-error behavior when reading a text aloud?
* How is such performance moderated by the relationship between the participant's own mood and the mood that a written passage endeavors to evoke?  Is valence or mood congruency a better predictor of performance?


## Background & Design
[Recent research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721419831992) is throwing away the old notion of "emotional" and "non-emotional" experiences and redefining valence and arousal as central to cognition. In this way, a person's mood might be viewed as a "filter" through which they experience the world.  When faced with conflicting emotional stimuli, an individual might be required to deploy inhibitory control in order to ignore their own mood to optimally process external stimuli.  One would be expected to perform better (faster, more accurately) on any task when they do not have to expend resources on such inhibitory control. Alternatively, there may be a "priming effect" that facilitates reading valenced words that either match one's mood or are congruent with the valence of recently read words. Likewise, switching between ends of the valence spectrum may operate similarly to switching between tasks, with emotional switches serving as stumbling blocks to the smooth execution of a task. Finally, the valence of the text being read may impact the reader's ability to detect and respond to mistakes made while reading. That is, insofar as errors are implicitly negative events, the ability to detect and react to errors while reading aloud may be directly influenced by the valence of the text being read.

This research idea dives into these questions by exploring speed and articulation accuracy in an ecologically valid context: reading a text aloud.  Texts are designed to be heavy on emotional words, allowing performance to be analyzed according to elements of the stimuli themselves (passage valence and direction of the emotional switch) as well as on individual differences (mood state, emotion regulation abilities, and measures of anxiety).
